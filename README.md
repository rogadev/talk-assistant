# talk-assistant

I was really tired of using [Google Assistant](https://assistant.google.com/). The technology has been garbage for years by my standards and it hasn't seen a single significant upgrade since its launch in 2016. `talk-assistant` is the virtual assistant that I always wanted with better speech recognition, more intelligence, superior functionality, and also better privacy. It's still in development, but the fact that it already works better than Google Assistant but developed by one junior developer really shows how far behind the times Google Assistant truly is.
