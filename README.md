# talk-assistant

I was really tired of using Google Assistant. The technology is garbage and it hasn't seen a significant upgrade since its launch in 2016. `talk-assistant` is the virtual assistant that I always wanted with better speech recognition, more intelligence, and better privacy. It's still in development, but the fact that it already works better than Google Assistant but developed by one junior developer really shows how far behind the times Google Assistant truly is.
